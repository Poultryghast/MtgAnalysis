    <p>In Magic: the Gathering, designing a powerful deck is often more complex than the main game. In order to make it easier to build competitive decks, this project synthesizes decks from tournaments and shows the results on this website. </p>
    <p>Tournament decks are used to identify common themes with which players can build their decks. Advanced players can design their decks to counter these themes. Each theme is shown as some of the central cards that support it and the art image of one of these cards.</p>
    <p>Clicking one of these images goes to a deck that's designed around the corresponding theme. Clicking any card will go to a third-party website that provides card details.</p>
